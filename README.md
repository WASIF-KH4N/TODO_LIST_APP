This Todo List app is built using Flutter and features a stylish gradient background and a user-friendly interface. The app allows users to add new todo items by typing in a text field and clicking the "Add" button, which adds the item to a list view. Each item in the list view is displayed with a delete icon, which can be pressed to remove the item from the list. The app's state is managed by a StatefulWidget called TodoListScreen, which holds the list of todo items and updates the UI accordingly. The app's UI is composed of a Scaffold with an AppBar and a Stack of widgets, including a Container with a gradient background and a Center widget that contains the todo list UI.
